furl - a linux command line utility that fetches and prints the contents of
the designated HTTP/HTTPS URL. This is a simplified lightweight embeddedable
replacement for the curl CLI program, for use with scripted control systems.

Usage:

    furl [options] URL

Options are:

    -d          - POST data from stdin (use twice to url-encode it)
    -f          - Follow HTTP redirects
    -p pin      - Use pinned HTTPS public key
    -s          - Verify HTTPS certificate signature
    -t seconds  - Set transaction timeout
    -z          - Output debug data

Fetched content is always printed to stdout. Error and debug messages are
always printed to stderr.

Exit status can be one of:

    0 = Content fetched and printed successfully
    1 = Operational error (malformed command or URL, invalid cetificate, etc)
    2 = Server's HTTP status was not 2XX

HTTPS verification is disabled by default, and furl will work as expected with
self-signed certificates.

Use -s to enable normal HTTPS certificate verification, but note this requires
functional DNS, resolvable hostnames, the clock set with the correct time, and
the signing CA's certificate in the proper location.

Use -p to enable pinned HTTPS public key, this has no dependence on system
infrastructure. The pin is the base64-encoded SHA256 of a specific HTTPS key,
connections will only proceed for servers which use that key. For an existing
host the easiest way to determine the pin is:

  ./furl -px -z https://the.target.server 2>&1 | awk -F' sha256//' '/public key hash/{print $2}'
